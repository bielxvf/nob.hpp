# nob.hpp
Tsoding's [nob.h](https://github.com/tsoding/nob.h) but in C++ because I'm trying to learn and maybe it will be easier to use as a "scripting" language.

# Usage
1. Don't
2. You can copy `nob.hpp` to your project and create a `nob.cpp` build script following the example on this repo.

# TODO
- Asynchronous commands
- Command line "subcommands"/option handling for things like `./nob build` or `./nob test`
- Maybe handle dependencies as structs so its easier to make little changes for users
